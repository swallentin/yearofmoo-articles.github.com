        <h1>Why AngularJS?</h1>

        <p>
          HTML is great for declaring static documents, but it falters when we try to use it for declaring dynamic views in web-applications. AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div data-ng-switch-when="two">
        <h1>Alternatives</h1>

        <p>
          Other frameworks deal with HTMLâ€™s shortcomings by either abstracting away HTML, CSS, and/or JavaScript or by providing an imperative way for manipulating the DOM. Neither of these address the root problem that HTML was not designed for dynamic views.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div data-ng-switch-when="three">
        <h1>Extensibility</h1>

        <p>
          AngularJS is a toolset for building the framework most suited to your application development. It is fully extensible and works well with other libraries. Every feature can be modified or replaced to suit your unique development workflow and feature needs. Read on to find out how

    <button class="btn btn-primary" data-ng-click="slide='one'">Slide 4: Data Binding</button>
    <button class="btn btn-danger" data-ng-click="slide='two'">Slide 5: Controller</button>
    <button class="btn btn" data-ng-click="slide='three'">Slide 6: Plain JavaScript</button>
    <div data-ng-switch="slide" data-ng-animate="'slide'" class="slide-frame">
      <div data-ng-switch-when="one">
        <h1>Data Binding</h1>

        <p>
Data-binding is an automatic way of updating the view whenever the model changes, as well as updating the model whenever the view changes. This is awesome because it eliminates DOM manipulation from the list of things you have to worry about.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div data-ng-switch-when="two">
        <h1>Controller</h1>

        <p>
Controllers are the behavior behind the DOM elements. AngularJS lets you express the behavior in a clean readable form without the usual boilerplate of updating the DOM, registering callbacks or watching model changes.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div data-ng-switch-when="three">
        <h1>Plain JavaScript</h1>

        <p>
Unlike other frameworks, there is no need to inherit from proprietary types; to wrap the model in accessors methods. Just plain old JavaScript here. This makes your code easy to test, maintain, reuse, and again free from boilerplate.
